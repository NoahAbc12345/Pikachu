# Pikachu
A utility Discord bot for the Nincord server.

Pikachu is a simple bot that is currently being developed and expanded on. It is primarily a moderation bot, however it has other purposes. Unfortunately, Pikachu is not made with any other server in mind besides Nincord, so in order to make the bot properly work in other servers, it will have to be heavily modified. The source code is open for anyone to view and see how Pikachu works. Pikachu is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py package.

Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request which shortens or simplifies code, adds new commands you want to see, or anything else! Contributors are elligible to receive the **@Bot Contributor** role on the Nincord server.
